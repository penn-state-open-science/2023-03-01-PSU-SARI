# Sharing image & video data

## The challenge

</br></br></br>

. . .

Images/video of people pose risks of identification

## (One) solution

</br></br></br>

. . .

Alter images/videos

. . .

---

```{r, fig.cap="https://www.fiverr.com/visionesque/blur-faces-objects-brands-or-anything-else-in-your-video"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://fiverr-res.cloudinary.com/images/t_main1,q_auto,f_auto,q_auto,f_auto/gigs/49647129/original/50b3952f2fcb3e81874e1aca222281240d11b934/blur-faces-objects-brands-or-anything-else-in-your-video.png")
```

## But, altering images/video...

</br></br></br>

. . .

is time/resource consuming</br></br>

. . .

makes images/video less valuable for reuse by others</br></br>

. . .

might pose risks to participants (if using external service)

## (Another) solution

</br></br></br>

. . .

Share with *researchers* not with the public

. . .

Researchers with ethics training

. . .

Researchers subject to institutional supervision
  
## Share with participant permission

</br></br></br>

. . .

Share only with research team members OR </br>

. . .

Share with other researchers OR </br>

. . .

Share with other researchers + allow clips to be shown OR </br>

. . .

Share publicly

## Take homes

</br></br>

. . .

Images and video *can* be shared

. . .

Images and video *should* be shared

. . .

Images and video *are already being* shared

</br></br>

. . .

Let's share images and video...

to improve transparency and reproducibility

. . .

and accelerate discovery
